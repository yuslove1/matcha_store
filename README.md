# Matcha Store

This project is a static landing page for a fictional matcha store, built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It was a fun collaborative effort with **Adekunle Adebimpe** and inspired by a design found on LinkedIn (designer to be credited soon). The project served as a refreshing exercise to revisit our front-end development skills, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I remembered!

## Project Goal

The primary goal was to recreate the design using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on semantic HTML structure, clean CSS styling, and efficient JavaScript for any interactive elements.  We aimed to build a responsive and visually appealing landing page that effectively showcases the matcha products.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Provides the structural foundation of the page.
* **CSS:** Handles the styling and layout, ensuring responsiveness across different devices.
* **JavaScript:** Used for any interactive elements on the page (e.g., image cards, form submissions e.t.c).

## Design Inspiration

The design for this landing page was discovered on LinkedIn. We are currently working on identifying and properly crediting the original designer. We will update this README with the designer's information as soon as possible.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** The page adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops and mobile devices.
* **Hero Section:** A visually engaging hero section showcasing the matcha products and brand.
* **Product Showcase:** A section displaying various matcha products with descriptions and pricing.
* **About Us Section:** Information about the (fictional) matcha store and its mission.
* **Contact Form:** A form for users to contact the store (currently for demonstration purposes only).
